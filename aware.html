							<h2>What is diabetes?</h2>
							
							<p class="pg_size">Diabetes is the condition in which the body does not properly process food for use as energy. Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body either does not make enough insulin or cannot use its own insulin as well as it should. This causes sugars to build up in your blood.</p><br>

							<h3>Types of Diabetes</h3>
							<strong>There are 2 types of diabetes</strong><br><br>

							<b>Type 1 Diabetes</b>
								<p>The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1. Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.</p>

								<b>Type  2 Diabetes</b>
								<p>The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance). Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2. Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.</p>

							<h2>Causes of Diabetes</h2>

							<b>The role of glucose</b>
							<p class="pg_size">Sugar has a bad reputation, but there is one type of sugar, called glucose, that your body needs to function. Glucose is a monosaccharide or single sugar. When you eat a carbohydrate, like a piece of bread or bowl of cereal, your body breaks the food down into small molecules, including glucose, that your body can absorb. Glucose enters the bloodstream and travels to every part of the body to fulfill its essential purpose.</p><br>

							<b>Causes of type 1 diabetes</b>
							<p class="pg_size">The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system, which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses, attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what many of those factors are is still unclear.</p>

							<b>Causes of type 2 diabetes</b>
							<p>Insulin resistance: </p>
							<p>Insulin resistance is the common cause of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body loses its ability to use the insulin. Several factors can affect insulin resistance. Genetic susceptibility and lifestyle choices plays major role in insulin resistance.</p><br>

							<p>Lack of insulin: </p>
							<p>Type 2 diabetes also develops when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin to manage sugar levels in blood. These two are the main causes of type 2 diabetes. The exact cause of insulin resistance and lack of insulin is unknown. Several factors can affect type 2 diabetes. There is no single cause of diabetes type 2.</p><br>

							<p>Causes of gestational diabetes</p>
							<p>During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can not keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.</p><br>

							<p>Causes of pre-diabetes </p>
							<p>Prediabetes occurs when your body is not able to keep your sugar (glucose) at a normal level in your blood. Your blood sugar is higher than normal, but it is not high enough to be diabetes. The food you eat turns into sugar, which your body uses for energy. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin, which allows the sugar in blood to get into the body’s cells. But when your body can not use insulin the right way, the sugar does not move into cells. It stays in your blood instead. This is called insulin resistance.</p>

							<h2>Symptoms of diabetes</h2>

							<p>Individuals can experience different signs and symptoms of diabetes, and sometimes there may be no signs. Some of the signs commonly experienced include:</p>
							<p>You're taking more bathroom breaks
							When you have diabetes, your body becomes less efficient at breaking food down into sugar, so you have more sugar sitting in your bloodstream, says Dobbins. Your body gets rid of it by flushing it out in the urine. That is why you are going to the bathroom a lot.</p>

							<p>Urinating a lot will also make you feel parched. A common symptom Dobbins sees with patients is that they use drinks like juices, soda, or chocolate milk to quench their thirst. These sugary beverages then pack the bloodstream with excess sugar, which can lead to the problem all over again.</p><br>

							<b>You've lost a little weight</b>
							<p>Considering that being overweight is a risk factor for diabetes, it sounds counterintuitive that shedding pounds could be a sign of the disease. Weight loss comes from two things, One, from the water that you lose [from urinating]. Two, you lose some calories in the urine and you don’t absorb all the calories from the sugar in your blood.</p><br>

							<b>You feel shaky and hungry</b>
							<p>It is not uncommon for patients to suddenly feel unsteady and immediately need to reach for carbs. When you have high blood sugar, your body has a problem regulating its glucose. If you have eaten something high in carbohydrates, your body shoots out a little too much insulin, and your glucose drops quickly. This makes you feel shaky, and you tend to crave carbs or sugar. This can lead to a vicious cycle.</p><br>

							<b>You're tired all the time</b>
							<p>Of course you are exhausted every now and then. But ongoing fatigue is an important symptom to pay attention to. it might mean the food you are eating for energy is not being broken down and used by cells as it is supposed to.</p><br>

							<b>You're moody and grumpy</b>
							<p>When your blood sugar is out of whack, you just do not feel well, and might become more short-tempered. In fact, high blood sugar can mimic depression like symptoms.Symptoms of Diabetes</p><br>

							<b>Your vision seems blurry</b>
							<p>In the early stages of diabetes, the eye lens is not focusing well because glucose builds up in the eye, which temporarily changes its shape. In about six to eight weeks after your blood sugars are stabilized, you are not going to feel it anymore, the eye will adjust</p><br>

							<b>Your cuts and scrapes heal more slowly</b>
							<p>The immune system and the processes that help the body heal do not work so well when your sugar levels are high.</p><br>

							<b>Your feet tingles </b>
							<p>Elevated sugar levels can cause complications well before you realize you have diabetes. One of these is mild nerve damage, which can cause numbness in your feet.</p>

							<h2>Risk Factors</h2>

							<p>Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes.</p><br>
							<b>Risk factors for type 1 Diabetes</b>
							<p>Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include:</p>
							<b>Environmental factors</b>
							<p>Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes.</p><br>

							<b>Dietary factors</b>
							<p>These include low vitamin D consumption, early exposure to cows milk, and exposure to cereals before 4 months of age. None of these factors has been shown to directly cause type 1 diabetes.</p><br>

							<b>Sexual dysfunction</b>
							<p>In men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication. Women with diabetes may experience: a reduced sex drive (loss of libido), less pleasure from sex, vaginal dryness, less ability to orgasm, pain during sex.</p><br>

							<b>Premature menopause:</b>
							<p>The average age a woman goes through menopause is 51. Menopause before age 40 is considered premature and may be related to immune disorders such as Type 1 diabetes. Just as your body fights your pancreas when you have diabetes. The concern with premature menopause is increased risk of heart disease, osteoporosis and for some women, fertility.
							Infection or illness
							Some infections and illnesses, mostly rare ones, can damage your pancreas.
							</p><br>

							<b>Geography</b>
							<p>The incidence of type 1 diabetes tends to increase as you travel away from the equator. People living in Finland and Sardinia have the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes, about two to three times higher than rates in the United States and 400 times the incidence among people living in Venezuela.</p><br>

							<b>Genetics</b>
							<p>The incidence of type 1 diabetes tends to increase as you travel away from the equator. People living in Finland and Sardinia have the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes, about two to three times higher than rates in the United States and 400 times the incidence among people living in Venezuela.
							The presence of certain genes indicates an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes.
							</p><br><br>

							<h3>Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes</h3>

							<b>Age</b>
							<p>Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults.</p><br>

							<b>Family history</b>
							<p>Type 2 diabetes has a hereditary factor. If someone in your close family has (or had) it, you are more likely to develop it.</p><br>

							<b>Weight</b>
							<p>Type 2 diabetes has a hereditary factor. If someone in your close family has (or had) it, you are more likely to develop it.</p><br>

							<b>Family history</b>
							<p>The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin.</p><br>

							<b>Less Active</b>
							<p>The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.</p><br>

							<b>Race</b>
							<p>Although it's unclear why, people of certain races including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans are at higher risk.</p><br>

							<b>Gestational diabetes</b>
							<p>If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><br>

							<b>Polycystic ovary syndrome</b>
							<p>If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes.
							For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity increases the risk of diabetes.
							</p><br>

							<b>High blood pressure</b>
							<p>Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><br>

							<b>Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels</b>
							<p>If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are.</p>
